NAME

    Net::SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol

ALPHA NOTICE

    **************************************************************** 

    This distribution is an alpha quality release of Net::SNMP 
    v4.0.0 and is subject to change.  The module has been completely 
    redesigned to add support for SNMPv3 and to follow the SNMP 
    Management Framework defined by RFC 2571.  Any problems, 
    suggestions, or comments should be e-mailed to the author.

    ****************************************************************
    
DESCRIPTION

    The module Net::SNMP implements an object oriented interface to
    the Simple Network Management Protocol. Perl applications can
    use the module to retrieve or update information on a remote
    host using the SNMP protocol. SNMPv1, SNMPv2c (Community-Based
    SNMPv2), and SNMPv3 are supported by the module. The Net::SNMP
    module assumes that the user has a basic understanding of the
    Simple Network Management Protocol and related network
    management concepts.

INSTALLATION

    To install, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
    distribution and do one of the following:

        a.  Create a makefile by running Perl against Makefile.PL and 
            then run make:

                perl Makefile.PL
                make test
                make install

        b.  Copy or move the entire directory structure (including 
            files) located under the lib/Net directory in the 
            distribution into a directory named Net in a Perl library 
            directory.

REQUIREMENTS

     Net::SNMP uses syntax that is not supported in versions of Perl 
     earlier than v5.6.0. 

     The non-core modules Crypt::DES, Digest::MD5, Digest::HMAC, and
     Digest::SHA1 are need to support SNMPv3.

DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation is included as part of the Net::SNMP module in
